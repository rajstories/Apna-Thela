A vendor should be able to compare the prices of raw materials from multiple suppliers + see their ratings and trust badges, so they can confidently choose the best deal."

You are a full-stack engineer. Build a simple, mobile-friendly UI component called “📊 Compare Suppliers” for my vendor platform.

🔧 Use stack: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla or React), Firebase (for DB), and Whisper or voice input support via AssemblyAI if voice is needed.

📍 WHERE TO PLACE:
- Add a new tab in the navbar: “Compare”
- OR, add a “Compare Prices” button inside the “Buy Raw Material” section (when user clicks on Aloo, Tomato, etc.)

📋 WHAT TO SHOW IN UI:

1. At the top: Show the selected item → 🥔 "Aloo"
2. Then display a simple table or cards with:
   - Supplier Name
   - 📦 Price (₹ per kg)
   - ⭐ Rating (out of 5)
   - ✅ Badge: “Trusted by X vendors” if they’ve had repeat buyers
   - 📍 Location (Pincode or Distance)
   - 📞 Button to Contact or “Order from this supplier”

✨ UI should be super clean, tap-friendly, and voice-friendly.
- Avoid dropdowns — use large buttons/icons.
- Ratings should use star icons 🌟🌟🌟🌟
- Trust badge = small green icon with text “Trusted”

🧠 BACKEND/FUNCTIONALITY:

- Data stored in Firebase like this:

```json
{
  "suppliers": {
    "supplier1": {
      "name": "Raj Veggie Mart",
      "item": "Aloo",
      "price_per_kg": 20,
      "rating": 4.7,
      "location": "110045",
      "trusted_by": 12
    },
    ...
  }
}
On item selection → Fetch all suppliers offering that item → Sort by Price (low to high)

Enable filter by:

Rating (4+ only)

Nearby (same pincode)

Trusted only ✅

💬 VOICE COMMANDS:
If mic is used, support:

“Compare Aloo prices” → Load comparison view for Aloo

“Cheapest onion seller” → Filter and highlight lowest-price seller for Pyaaz

Make everything work even in low network (use Firebase cache/Firestore offline mode)

📱 Make this mobile-first → Tap to Compare, Tap to Order.
